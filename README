A project for Distributed System course at Polimi (2013)

For managing the pending tasks for each one of the modules we can write here but another
team mate needs to do (for instance, fixing a bug identified, an algorithm missing, etc) and then to put when thist task was finished.

=================
TASKS NOTATION
=================
The notation is the following:
Pending task has the symbol "-" in front the task description.
Finished task hast the symbol "+" in front the task description.

=================
Andrea Mambretti
=================
-Implement application simple module
-Implement the invocation manager for the client 
-Implement client reincarnation
-Create the client compound module
-Test the modules and do the OMNET networks for it simulation

=================
Vinh The Hoang
=================
-Implement the basic multicast
-Implement the channel failures 
-Test the simulation on channel failures

=================
Monica Lozano
=================
-Implement the remoteWrite protocol with the primary table of data items
-Implement distributed mutual exclusion.
-Create Replica Compund Module (With Vinh help)
-Test the modules and do the OMNET networks for it simulation.

=================
DESIGN DOUBTS
=================
-Should we have one invocation manager for the client and another one for replica?
-Do we need to create another message format for the network communication?
